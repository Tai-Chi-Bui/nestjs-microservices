## **Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Microservices**
**Goal:** Establish the foundational infrastructure and build the first functional microservices.

### **Steps:**
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Install NestJS CLI, Docker, and Kubernetes tools.
   - Set up a monorepo structure with NestJS.
   - Create shared libraries for logging, authentication, and database utilities.

2. **Authentication Service**
   - Build a minimal `auth-service`:
     - User registration (email and password).
     - Login with JWT.
     - Basic user management APIs.
   - Integrate PostgreSQL for user data.
   - Create REST APIs for authentication.

3. **API Gateway**
   - Implement an API Gateway for routing and aggregating APIs.
   - Add middleware for logging and error handling.
   - Expose `/auth` endpoints via the gateway.

4. **Dockerize and Deploy**
   - Create `docker-compose.yml` to run `auth-service`, API Gateway, and PostgreSQL.
   - Deploy locally and test the end-to-end flow.

### **Deliverable:**
- **Running Features:** User registration and login with JWT through the API Gateway.
- **Milestone:** A basic but functional app is up and running.

## **Phase 2: Product Management Service**
**Goal:** Add functionality to manage products and integrate with the existing system.

### **Steps:**
1. **Product Service**
   - Create a `product-service` with:
     - CRUD APIs for managing products (name, description, price, etc.).
     - Database integration with PostgreSQL using Prisma ORM.

2. **API Gateway Integration**
   - Expose `/products` endpoints via the gateway.
   - Secure the endpoints using JWT authentication from `auth-service`.

3. **Basic Frontend (Optional for Testing)**
   - Use Postman or Swagger for testing APIs.
   - Alternatively, create a simple React or Next.js UI to interact with the backend.

### **Deliverable:**
- **Running Features:** Manage products with secure endpoints.
- **Milestone:** Two functional microservices interacting via the API Gateway.

---

## **Phase 3: Order Management Service**
**Goal:** Add the ability to place and manage orders.

### **Steps:**
1. **Order Service**
   - Create an `order-service` with:
     - APIs to place, view, and cancel orders.
     - Order schema linking users and products.
   - Integrate PostgreSQL for order data storage.

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Use Kafka to enable communication between services:
     - Notify `product-service` when an order is placed.
     - Update inventory in the `product-service`.

3. **API Gateway Integration**
   - Expose `/orders` endpoints via the API Gateway.

4. **Frontend for Testing**
   - Add minimal UI or test using tools like Postman.

### **Deliverable:**
- **Running Features:** Users can place orders, and inventory updates via Kafka.
- **Milestone:** Core microservices (auth, product, order) fully integrated.

---

## **Phase 4: Monitoring and Observability**
**Goal:** Add tools for system monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting.

### **Steps:**
1. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Integrate Prometheus for metrics collection.
   - Use Grafana for visualizing system health.
   - Add ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

2. **Distributed Tracing**
   - Use OpenTelemetry for tracing requests across microservices.
   - Visualize traces in Jaeger or Grafana.

3. **Alerting**
   - Configure alerts for critical events (e.g., service downtime, high latency).

### **Deliverable:**
- **Running Features:** Full observability with metrics, logs, and traces.
- **Milestone:** Production-ready monitoring.

---

## **Phase 5: Scaling and Advanced Features**
**Goal:** Prepare for production with scalability, advanced security, and CI/CD.

### **Steps:**
1. **Kubernetes Deployment**
   - Containerize all services with Docker.
   - Deploy services to Kubernetes with Helm charts.
   - Configure load balancing and service discovery.

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 for third-party authentication.
   - Add role-based access control (RBAC).

3. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
   - Create Terraform scripts for managing cloud infrastructure.

4. **Additional Services**
   - Implement additional microservices as required (e.g., analytics, notifications).
   - Refactor shared libraries to support new features.

### **Deliverable:**
- **Running Features:** A scalable, production-ready application.
- **Milestone:** Fully operational system ready for deployment.

---

## **Phase 6: Frontend Integration**
**Goal:** Provide a complete user interface for interacting with the application.

### **Steps:**
1. **Frontend Development**
   - Use Next.js or React to create the UI.
   - Implement user dashboards, product listings, and order management pages.

2. **Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - Connect the frontend with the API Gateway.
   - Add support for GraphQL (if required) for complex queries.

3. **Optimization**
   - Optimize frontend performance (e.g., lazy loading, caching).
   - Add end-to-end tests for user workflows.

### **Deliverable:**
- **Running Features:** A fully functional UI connected to the backend.
- **Milestone:** Complete user experience.

---

## **Phase 7: Enhancements and Maintenance**
**Goal:** Improve and expand the system based on user feedback.

### **Steps:**
1. **New Features**
   - Add features like reporting, analytics, or recommendations.
   - Enhance event-driven architecture for new use cases.

2. **Optimization**
   - Optimize database queries and microservices performance.
   - Scale services as needed.

3. **Maintenance**
   - Regularly update dependencies.
   - Monitor logs and metrics for potential issues.
